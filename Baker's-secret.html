        <h3>Mixing Methods</h3>
        <p>Cookies, like quick breads and cake batters, are made from a rich dough that is mixed using the creaming method. Most cookie doughs contain less liquid than other batter, so you do not need to alternate your flour and liquid. Cookies can be leavened with baking soda, baking powder, or just plain air and steam. Cookie recipes with high-fat percentages and low moisture generally do not have issues with over-development of gluten. However, careless mixing can produce a dense, tough cookie...</p>

        <h3>Make-up Techniques</h3>
        <p>There are many varieties of classifications for cookies. This refers to how the cookie dough is shaped after mixing. Some examples include drop cookies, icebox cookies, bar cookies, and molded cookies. Let's explore some of these techniques in more detail.</p>

        <h3>Drop Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are made by scooping or spooning dough into mounds and baking. Examples include chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies. While it is not crucial for these cookies to be uniform in shape, it is a good practice to keep them uniform in size and placement for even baking. Use a scoop for even portions and space them far enough apart to allow for spreading during baking.</p>

        <h3>Bar Cookies</h3>
        <p>Bar cookies are made from stiff dough that is rolled into a log, baked, and then cut into slices. A well-known example is biscotti, which is baked a second time for extra crispness and shelf life.</p>

        <h3>Sheet Cookies</h3>
        <p>Sheet cookies are baked in a shallow pan and cut into portions afterward. They are often used for desserts like lemon bars, date squares, or brownies. These cookies are ideal for serving large groups as they allow for precise portioning.</p>

        <h3>Rolled or Molded Cookies</h3>
        <p>Rolled or molded cookies are made from stiff dough that can be shaped into balls, crescents, or other shapes. Shortbread cookies, for example, are often pressed into molds for intricate designs. The dough must be firm and dry to maintain its shape during baking.</p>

        <h3>Wafer Cookies</h3>
        <p>Wafer cookies are made from a thin egg foam batter spread onto a baking sheet. While still warm, they can be molded into various shapes, such as a rolled cigarette or cone shape.</p>
